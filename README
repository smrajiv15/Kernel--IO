KERNEL IO TOOL
--------------

Kernel IO is a tool which generates IO request from the kernel block layer.
Existing tools generates IO from the user space and the device performance is
strongly influenced by excessive number of system calls and context switches.

Buffer cache also plays an important role in measuring the throughput of the
system. Some times data is read from the cache if it finds the data. So, 
the performance of the system also depends on it.

Why Kernel IO tool?
-------------------
1. This tool generates IO at the generic block layer, bypassing VFS, filesystem
layer and buffer cache.
2. Since it runs at a kernel level, it eliminates the overhead caused by system 
calls and context switches.
3. Bypasses many software layers as possible and gets close to the device giving 
precise performance measurement.


NOTE: This driver is only compatible with the kernel version - 3.16

Steps to run
------------
1. Go to Kio_Mod folder and run the make command.

2. Install the kernel Module:
   insmod kernelio.ko

3. After the successful installation check for kio device in the dev directory.

4. Next, go to Kio_tool directory and compile the application with:
   gcc -Wall -lpthread kiotool.c -o kiotool

5. Then you can give the IO specification either in a file or by means of command
   line arguments.

	 command line:
	 -------------
	 kiotool â€“dev <block_device> --runtime <time_in_seconds> --rw <IO_type> --pattern <data>

	 With Work-load file
	 -------------------
	 kiotool workload.txt
